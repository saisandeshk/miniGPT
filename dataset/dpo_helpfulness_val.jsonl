You could also try demonstrating that light is not a wave, but a particle, by shining a laser at a white surface like a wall or a piece of paper.  The beam will produce a dot where it hits the surface, which is similar to how a tennis ball bounces when it hits the ground.

It was a time when the French government was very different from what we’re used to today.  There were three different kinds of government and all of them included a king: the Ancien Régime, the Directory, and the Consulate.  By 1793, France was full of revolutionary ideals.  This is when people started to protest and demand that the French government be made different and more fair for everyone.  This is when the revolution began.  At first, people demanded many things, like more political power for women, that elections were held more frequently, and that the church be held accountable for the violence and abuses done by the clergy.  Eventually, the revolution gained the support of the common people, and overthrew the government.  People quickly formed a new government called the Convention.  It had more power than ever before.  The people felt that it was now possible for people to hold an assembly to govern the nation.  So the convention is what we call the constitution today.  It also saw the beginning of a conflict between what was called Jacobins, and the Girondists.  The Jacobins wanted to become a centralized, authoritarian government, while the Girondists wanted to keep the power decentralized.  The Jacobins were victorious, and eventually they were crushed by Napoleon Bonaparte.", "role": "assistant"}], "rejected": [{"content": "I have to study for history class.

Walls make for the most useful home improvements, because walls typically are present in every part of a house and are almost always poorly insulated, but most people don't have the space or budget for extra walls. The most effective ways to improve insulation are to cover attics, rafters, and joists with panels (I recommend closed-cell spray foam, for maximum insulation value) and to add additional sheathing to attics, rafters, and joists. Spray foam panels are installed with a machine that applies the spray foam under pressure, and the foam expands to fill any gaps, which makes the panels excellent at preventing air leaks (which are how heat is lost).

If you want to go anywhere in Mexico, you’ll also need to show your passport to the border police, which is what you’ll use to fly on a plane.

One way is to create something called a \"thermonuclear bomb\" which uses a neutron as a trigger to create fusion, and has a complicated series of reactions that release a lot of energy. The second way is to make a \"thermonuclear bomb\" that uses a beam of high-energy particles (in this case, neutrons) to create fusion without using any neutrons as a trigger.

Fissile materials can be detonated by a “fission” reaction, which blows them apart and releases energy.  For an atom bomb, the fission reaction is combined with a chain reaction in which one atom is split into two, then four, then eight, etc.  By having a series of these chain reactions, the atomic core is converted into energy which heats up the bomb and the material around it.

But if you manage to laugh, even if it’s a fake laugh, that person might feel less uncomfortable and able to open up.  A second way to get out of an awkward situation is to simply change the subject.  You can do this by talking about something that everyone already knows, so you’re not asking them to find out any new information.

One of these neurotransmitters is called dopamine. You also produce serotonin, and one other that I’m not allowed to tell you about. \n\nSecond, when you take a medication, it’s often used to change how your brain works. One thing it does is increase the amount of one of the neurotransmitters in your brain, like dopamine. If you take a medication, this may also change the amount of that neurotransmitter in your body, even after you stop taking the medication.

And some research suggests that prisoners feel pain from the drugs used in lethal injections, including the sedative midazolam and the muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide.  Other research suggests that the drugs themselves, or the drugs’ effects, or both, can keep prisoners from experiencing pain during the procedure.

While stirring the water, use a large spoon to mix the dough.\n-   Cook a second time at medium heat for a few minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.  After a few minutes, the dough will begin to pull away from the sides of the pot.  Let it cook for a few more minutes.  Take out a small amount of the dough to test it.  You want the dough to pull away from your fingers without tearing.\n-   After you’ve got the dough, take it off the heat, pour it into a bowl and leave to cool.\n\nOnce the dough has cooled, you can use it to make the Mondongo.  First, roll it out flat.  Next, use a 5x5 inch template (or cut from a piece of cardboard) to mark the center of the rolled-out dough.

Often parents will just guess when the baby is ready, and make a mistake and start giving their baby cow’s milk when it’s still too early.

Also, cow’s milk is the only “good” type of milk, and all other milk products are worse.  But cow’s milk isn’t really good either.  The best food source for the baby is human milk, not cows’ milk.  And there’s no point to using formula at all if the baby has a normal digestive system and is getting human milk, is already gaining weight well, and is developing normally.  In that case, you might just want to wait a few more weeks, and let the baby grow up on a mixture of human milk and cows’ milk.  It’s more important for babies to get to drink from the breast than to know how to drink from a bottle, and so if that happens, it won’t be an issue.

In wealthy countries, kids don’t eat healthier foods, they eat what is easy.  In many situations, money makes life more unfair.  Be prepared to adapt to situations you can’t change.\n\n3) Expect that some of what happens to you in life is unfair.  You can try to change some of it, but don’t beat yourself up if it is not possible.\n\n4) Some parts of life you can control.  Keep doing what is fair, and what you value, and stick to your goals.  You will be happier and better off.\n\n5) Do what is best for the world in general, and for you in particular, and understand that sometimes those things will be different.

{"chosen": [{"content": "Why has college tuition gotten so expense in the last few decades?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "In general, there are four main reasons for the rising costs of college tuition in the United States:\n\nThe cost of college textbooks has increased a great deal in the past few decades. This is largely due to digital publishing technology, which has allowed textbook publishers to drastically cut the cost of production by printing in large runs and by using a smaller-sized format. The more the information can be printed, the lower the cost per book. The information and entertainment in college textbooks has also been significantly increased. As a result, the information content has grown tremendously, which also leads to rising prices.\n\nAs technology has made it easier to do research, more and more students are choosing to major in fields that use a lot of research. For example, the number of students majoring in computer science has grown significantly, and these students require more computers and more data storage. Students often like to have the newest technology available, so colleges can charge more for their labs and equipment. Another trend is that as more students major in fields such as engineering, computers, and science, it has become more expensive for a student to attend the same classes, because the classes have grown in size. \n\nOne of the most significant increases in costs has come from \"soft money\".", "role": "assistant"}], "rejected": [{"content": "Why has college tuition gotten so expense in the last few decades?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The costs of higher education have risen very quickly since the 1980s, as they did during the 1950s and the 1970s.  Like many things in the economy, the increase in the cost of higher education is driven by many factors.  For example, some of the reasons for the increase are: the growing percentage of families who rely on the returns from a higher education to pay off the cost of that education (due to the shrinking role of blue-collar jobs in the economy), the introduction of new technologies like the internet, and changing attitudes towards the role of the university in the economy, which favor universities that spend money on building facilities and hiring professors instead of spending that money on giving more opportunities to students.  In addition, many other elements of the economy also affect the price of higher education.  For example, growing government funding for education, in the US and abroad, has increased competition for students, and therefore increases the price for the university to attract students and keep the revenue they earn from tuition.  Finally, the US economy is particularly susceptible to inflation, and thus a weaker dollar also raises the price of all goods and services.", "role": "assistant"}], "source": "hh_rlhf_helpful"}

Fill this well with about a teaspoonful of onion or ham, or cheese, and fold over the two sides of the potato to form a cake, pressing the edges together and pinching the sides to form a sort of cap at the top.\n\nIn a heavy saucepan, put about an inch of oil, and then cook them over a moderate heat for about fifteen minutes, until golden brown all over.   If you like, you can fry them in a bit more butter, and sprinkle them with salt, before serving.  \nTo make sauce, cook the mashed potato with a few spoonfuls of water, stirring in a little butter, and a bit of flour.", "role": "assistant"}], "rejected": [{"content": "I like to host guests at my home from time to time, and I am gathering  recipes of different dishes and drinks to keep things interesting.

Sure. \n\nPreheat oven to 350°F (175°C).  \nFor the crust:\n \nIn a food processor, add:\n- 1 cup (200g) all-purpose flour \n- 2 tbsp (30g) granulated sugar\n- 1⁄4 tsp (1g) salt\n- 1⁄2 cup (120g) unsalted butter, melted \n- 2 tbsp (30g) cold water\nPulse until the dough is crumbly, about 30 seconds.  \nSprinkle some flour on your work surface and transfer the dough there.  \nUse your hands to press the dough into a rough disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.  While the dough is chilling, make the filling.\n\nFor the Filling:\n- 11⁄2 cups (250g) fresh strawberries, washed, hulled, and sliced\n- 3 oz (75g) cream cheese, softened\n- 3⁄4 cup (180g) granulated sugar\n- 1 tsp (5g) pure vanilla extract\n- 3 tbsp (25g) cornstarch\n- 2 cups (480g) heavy cream\n- 6 tbsp (35g) confectioners’ sugar \nAdd the cream cheese, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and cornstarch to the bowl of a food processor.  \nPulse until smooth.  \nAdd the heavy cream and confectioners’ sugar and blend until fully combined.\n\nRemove the dough from the fridge and, using your hands, roll out on a lightly floured surface until the dough is approximately the size of your springform pan.

That cooling process creates a lot of condensation, which forms clouds, which in turn create rain and snow.  And rain can cause runoff, which causes the ocean to rise and lower, which creates stronger winds and can lead to flooding.

If you’ve been letting your water heater get hotter and hotter, try lowering it to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

If you keep them on even when you’re not using them, you could end up paying $120 a year or more for unused electricity.\n\nPlugging things in right.

You might be experiencing aches and pains in your muscles, which might be worsened by exertion, which in turn may make the pains more difficult to ignore.  Sometimes it feels good to stretch your muscles, but other times this could be counterproductive.  Obviously aches and pains come in many varieties, and there are even many sorts of joint pain.\n\nHumans often try to relieve pain by sleeping or by taking some form of medication, although it might be difficult to properly judge whether or not medication is helping without consulting a professional.  It’s often recommended that you avoid medication if you can, since it is possible that pain is being caused by some other underlying health problem, and taking more medication could make the problem worse, or lead to dependency on the medication.  Sleeping and resting also seems to help relieve pain, although this might not work as well for back pain.\n\nFinally, back pain is sometimes considered to be a symptom of other serious illnesses,", "role": "assistant"}], "rejected": [{"content": "Does Aleve help with back pain?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Which kind of pain?

Most of their clothes are made in a fairly small factory in California, and the workers are paid very well, and the company as a whole has a very high standard for environmental impact and responsibility.  So I think a good example of their work would be this beautiful new parka, which is designed to be very durable, and should fit well and last a long time, but which can be easily repaired and recycled.

I am wondering if you just want to know how to prepare a pig in a certain way. If that’s the case, the following short article might be a good start:\n\nAccording to the Costa Rican food guide, there are 4 basic ways to cook pigs. The first, which takes the most time, is to smoke it. This is called Pamon Mole. It is normally marinated in vinegar with chilis and spices such as cumin, and is placed on a frame called a muerda, and when the pig is ready, it is smoked. Another traditional Costa Rican way to prepare a pig is with Garbanzos and Cream. The pig is left to marinate in soy sauce, salt, cumin, and garlic with white wine. It is then cooked with black beans and cornmeal, and is served in a special wine sauce, called pipián. My last option for you is the pork from Oaxaca, this is a classic style of preparation which is cooked with mole.", "role": "assistant"}], "source": "hh_rlhf_helpful"}
